    The point of <em>LifeLoggerz</em> isn’t just to show what I track — it’s to show <strong>why</strong> I started doing it in the first place.
    Here are the people, projects, and philosophies that pushed me down this rabbit hole of data and discipline.
  </p>

  {/* 1. Phil Von Stade */}

  <h2>🎥 Phil Von Stade — The Original Life Logger</h2>
  <p>
    I thought I invented life-logging until I found
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2yIGGxg52A" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Phil Von Stade’s video</a> from over 16 years ago.
    He was tracking his entire life long before spreadsheets went viral — a pioneer of quantified living before it even had a name.
  </p>

  {/* 2. Efficiency Is Everything */}

  <h2>⚡ Efficiency Is Everything</h2>
  <p>
    <a href="https://efficiencyiseverything.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Efficiency Is Everything</a> was one of the first blogs that changed how I thought about time and optimization.
    The creator breaks down things like the <strong>cheapest foods per calorie</strong>, and how much time you lose on daily tasks.
  </p>
  <p>This mindset <strong>kindled my rush to save time</strong>, since we all only have 24 hours a day.</p>

  {/* 3. Michael Phelps */}

  <h2>🏊 Michael Phelps and Journaling</h2>
  <p>
    Even world-class athletes do it.
    After reading
    <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6131365/2025/02/20/michael-phelps-journals-to-find-the-best-version-of-himself-when-i-tried-it-the-results-surprised-me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> this article about Michael Phelps</a>,
    I realized he’s been journaling for years.
  </p>
  <p>You know what Google Sheets has over journaling?</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You can <strong>Ctrl + F</strong> for specific thoughts or entries.</li>
    <li>You can <strong>see the data evolve</strong> over time.</li>
    <li>A full year can be analyzed in minutes — and you still have every log.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>That’s when I knew structured journaling could become something bigger.</p>

  {/* 4. Perfice */}
  <SectionHero
    src="/images/perfice.png"
    alt="Perfice life-tracking app"
/>
  <h2>📱 Perfice — Tracking Life as an App</h2>
  <p>
    <a href="https://perfice.adoe.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Perfice</a> is a clean, minimal life-tracking app.
    I could build something similar one day — but for now, I enjoy the <strong>interactivity and transparency</strong> of my Google Sheets systems.
    You see your data face-first — not buried in menus or dashboards.
  </p>

  {/* 5. Feltron */}
  <SectionHero

    alt="Feltron 2013 Life Report"

  <h2>🎨 Feltron’s 2013 Annual Report</h2>
  <p>
    Nicholas Felton’s
    <a href="http://feltron.com/FAR14.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> 2013 Life Report</a>
    blew my mind. The design, typography, and storytelling made raw data feel <strong>alive</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Feel free to improve on my systems in the <strong>aesthetics department</strong>.
    I haven’t explored Looker Studio or Power BI yet, but visual storytelling is high on my list for future upgrades.
  </p>

  {/* 6. Raptitude */}
  <SectionHero
    src="/images/raptitude.png"
    alt="Raptitude blog"
/>
  <h2>🌱 Raptitude — Experiments in Living Better</h2>
  <p>
    <a href="https://www.raptitude.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Raptitude</a> inspired me to view self-improvement as a series of
    <strong> experiments</strong>. It’s not about perfection; it’s about iteration.
  </p>
  <p>My blog isn’t just about tracking — it’s about <strong>improving workflows, free time, and ultimately life</strong>.</p>

  {/* 7. Quantified Self */}
  <SectionHero
    src="/images/dailyvis.png"
    alt="Quantified Self"
/>
  <h2>📊 The Quantified Self Movement</h2>
  <p>
    The <a href="https://dailyvis.com/posts/quantified-self-why-i-track-my-life-in-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quantified Self</a> community taught me what’s possible when people turn
    <strong> awareness into numbers</strong>. They showed that life-logging isn’t obsessive — it’s <strong>reflective</strong>.
    It’s not about collecting data for data’s sake, but using it to make better decisions.
  </p>

  {/* 8. RYOT */}
  <SectionHero
    src="/images/ryot.png"
    alt="RYOT GitHub"

  <h2>📊 RYOT GitHub</h2>
  <p>
    The <a href="https://github.com/IgnisDa/ryot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quantified Self</a> community taught me what’s possible when people turn
    <strong> awareness into numbers</strong>. They showed that life-logging isn’t obsessive — it’s <strong>reflective</strong>.
    It’s not about collecting data for data’s sake, but using it to make better decisions.
  </p>

  <h2>💬 Final Thoughts</h2>
  <p>
    You think you can do better? Try Looker Studio, Power BI, or any tool I haven’t explored yet.
    I avoid deep biometrics for now — there’s still plenty to optimize manually.
  </p>
  <p>
    When I was younger, I kept <strong>stacks of notes</strong> and filled whiteboards trying to organize ideas. It was chaos.
  </p>
  <p>
    In <strong>January 2023</strong>, I began logging simple stats in Google Sheets.
    By <strong>July 2023</strong>, I realized I could <strong>organize my entire mind in Excel</strong> — and that’s when
    <em> LifeLoggerz</em> truly began.
