    Welcome! I’m <strong>José</strong> — the kid sitting down with pen and paper in the photo above. I'm a grad student and the guy behind
    <strong>LifeLoggerz</strong>. I’m obsessed with optimizing my time and turning variable actions into clean,
    repeatable systems. When I'm not working or pursuing my other hobbies, I build Google Sheets dashboards, Python tools, and routines that make research (and life)
    more efficient.
  </p>

  <h2>🎓 How Did This All Start?</h2>
  <p>
    When I was younger, I kept stacks of notes and filled whiteboards trying to organize ideas. It was chaos since I was constantly moving ideas and thoughts, rewriting the same old info.
  </p>
  <p>
    In <strong>January 2023</strong>, I began logging simple stats in Google Sheets as a self-improvement project after reading some Reddit posts showcasing simple Excel sheets.
    By <strong>July 2023</strong>, I realized that I could <strong>organize my entire mind in spreadsheets</strong>. Check out the 2023, 2024, and 2025 raw data sheets for insight into how these sheets evolved.
    I had no professional experience with Excel or Google Sheets before, so I learned formula by formula. Formulas gave way to formatting, and then I learned how to use Google App Script to automate processes. 
    It only takes 5 minutes for me to log my essential stats, and my diary log can take much longer. However, logging has become second-nature. Doesn't matter how beat or tired I am, it's gotta get done... 
  </p>

  <h2>📊 LifeLoggerz Philosophy</h2>
  <p>
    Small habits compound. I initially tracked only hours slept and my 3 daily meals, but that evolved into the current tracking of ...152... stats. 
    These include ... sleep, food, health, work hours, study logs, music, books, and even
    “blunders” in Google Sheets for some time now. These logs became a personal operating system: a way to make decisions
    based on data. LifeLoggerz shares the templates and code so you can borrow what helps and build your own systems.
  </p>

  <h2>🛠 Tools & Systems I Share</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Google Sheets templates and dashboards for daily life and research</li>
    <li>Python apps for analysis, visualization, and exports (Excel/PowerPoint)</li>
    <li>Templates, checklists, and routines that reduce friction</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🎸 Beyond the Lab</h2>
  <p>
    When I’m not elbow-deep in research or spreadsheets, I’m usually practicing guitar (Flamenco, Mariachi, and Classical),
    exploring literature and philosophy, or helping with my family’s concrete business. I like walks with audiobooks and
    anything that pairs learning with movement.
  </p>

  <h2>🌱 Why This Blog Exists</h2>
  <p>
    For the past 3 years, I've given impromptu demos of my systems to people. Publishing them here allows you to interact with these systems directly.
    If you’re curious about tracking your habits, streamlining research, or building your own life-OS, you’re in the right place.
