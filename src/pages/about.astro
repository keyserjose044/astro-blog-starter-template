    Hi! I’m <strong>John</strong> — a Civil Engineering PhD student at UTA and the human behind
    <strong> LifeLoggerz</strong>. I’m obsessed with turning messy real-world work and habits into clean,
    repeatable systems. By day I study concrete materials at the Center for Advanced Construction Materials
    (CACM). By night I build Google Sheets dashboards, Python tools, and routines that make research (and life)
    more efficient.
  </p>

  <h2>🎓 Research & Engineering</h2>
  <p>
    My research focuses on cementitious materials and performance testing. In the lab, I cast and test specimens
    and run workflows like Load–CMOD, TGA, XRD, and Vicat. I care about <em>precision, speed, and clarity</em>—so I
    write modular Python apps to automate data processing, charting, and report outputs.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Automation for Load–CMOD analysis with live manipulation overlays and Excel export</li>
    <li>Auto-TGA processing with DTG controls and composite charts</li>
    <li>Batch tooling for experiment data, tidy outputs, and presentation-ready visuals</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>📊 LifeLoggerz Philosophy</h2>
  <p>
    Small habits compound. I’ve tracked sleep, food, health, work hours, study logs, music, books, and even
    “blunders” in Google Sheets for years. These logs became a personal operating system: a way to make decisions
    based on data, not vibes. LifeLoggerz shares the templates and code so you can borrow what helps and ignore the rest.
  </p>

  <h2>🛠 Tools & Systems I Share</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Google Sheets dashboards for daily life and research</li>
    <li>Python apps for analysis, visualization, and exports (Excel/PowerPoint)</li>
    <li>Templates, checklists, and routines that reduce friction</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🎸 Beyond the Lab</h2>
  <p>
    When I’m not elbow-deep in cement or spreadsheets, I’m usually practicing guitar (Flamenco, Mariachi, and classics),
    exploring literature and philosophy, or helping with my family’s concrete business. I like walks with audiobooks and
    anything that pairs learning with movement.
  </p>

  <h2>🌱 Why This Blog Exists</h2>
  <p>
    Friends kept asking for my systems. I kept giving impromptu demos. Publishing them here is more scalable—and more useful.
    If you’re curious about tracking your habits, streamlining research, or building your own life-OS, you’re in the right place.
