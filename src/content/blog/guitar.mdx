# 🎸 Flamenco at My Fingertips — Growing One Strum at a Time

I’m not a virtuoso, but I **practice every day**.  
Some evenings, I only have ten minutes to spare between research and rest — but I always pick up the guitar.  
Little by little, calluses formed, muscle memory settled in, and what once felt impossible started to flow.

It’s been roughly **350 hours** since I began this amateur flamenco journey, and I still feel like I’m just scratching the surface. Yet every day, I’m reminded that *consistency always beats intensity*.

## 🌱 How It Started

When I first began, I couldn’t even roll a proper rasgueado. My fingers fumbled, my rhythm lagged, and my hands cramped after minutes. But I promised myself to **enjoy the process**, not just chase perfection.

I built a gallery of YouTube lessons and performances — short clips that shaped how I play. Watching them again now feels surreal: every small repetition, every “aha” moment, quietly built into a foundation.

## 🔥 Where I Am Now

Fast-forward to today, and I can play simple **flamenco flourishes**, transitions, and compás patterns that used to feel unreachable.  
The goal was never to “master” it overnight, but to integrate music into life — to make practice as natural as brushing my teeth.

I sometimes record short clips of my playing. It’s humbling and exciting to compare them month by month — clear, visual proof that time *does* compound skill.

## 🧭 How You Can Start (and Grow Alongside Me)

If you’ve ever thought, “I wish I could play guitar,” start with this:  
**five minutes a day.**  

Forget perfection — focus on contact, sound, and curiosity.  
In a few days, you’ll go from *zero* to *“Wow, I can do that?”*  

These flamenco flourishes don’t take long to learn. You’ll mess up a thousand times, but that’s the point. Every missed note trains you to hear better, feel deeper, and persist longer.

If you want to follow along, I’ve curated a **video gallery** of the exact lessons I watched to get here — the same 350 hours that grew this passion from spark to sound.

## 🎶 The Seed That Keeps Growing

Amateur flamenco sparked something in me — not mastery, but *momentum*.  
Every day, I’m growing a little more rhythmic, a little more expressive. And I know where this leads: slow, quiet transformation through daily effort.

I’ll keep practicing, logging, and sharing the journey — one strum at a time.

*“The strings remember every day you showed up.”*
