# 🎨 The DailyArt Challenge — One Artwork a Day for Life

When I get up, I have a list of small morning tasks that I knock out without fail.  
They take only a few minutes each — stretching, making tea, checking the weather, logging my sleep — and one of them is *looking at art*.

Every day, I open the **DailyArt app** and spend at least **30 seconds** staring at a painting or sculpture. I read its story, note the artist, the movement, and the year — and then sit with it quietly.  

Through this tiny habit, I’ve started to understand the cultural world around me.  
Whenever I walk through a museum, I catch hints of brushwork, color, or subject that whisper, *“You’ve seen something like this before.”* It’s slow education — one image at a time.

## 🖼️ The Gallery in Motion

The real magic happens over time.  
Since **January 1, 2024**, I’ve been logging every piece I see into a **Google Sheets tracker** — now hundreds of rows long.

The gallery on my site is generated automatically.  
Each new record adds to an expanding timeline of world art — a growing museum that reflects my own aesthetic evolution.

## 📊 Behind the Scenes — Data Meets Art

In the Sheet, every artwork is catalogued with:

- **Piece**
- **Artist**
- **Country of Origin**
- **Medium**
- **Movement**
- **Year**

An **Apps Script + ChatGPT API** combination fills in the *Movement* field and embeds a Wikipedia link for the artist.  
Another script pushes the finalized metadata into **Raindrop**, where my gallery lives.

Hovering over a thumbnail in the gallery reveals its metadata.  
Double-clicking takes you straight to the museum page to explore the work in depth.  
It’s a fully automated learning loop — from phone app → Google Sheets → online gallery.

## 📱 The DailyArt App

If you haven’t used **DailyArt**, I can’t recommend it enough.  
It’s free, thoughtfully curated, and draws from hundreds of museums worldwide.  
No ads, no noise — just art and a short daily essay.

## 🌅 Reflections on the Habit

The point isn’t to memorize dates or movements.  
It’s to **stay connected to beauty**, even when life is chaotic.  

By turning this into a quantifiable habit — one line a day in Sheets — I’m teaching myself to recognize patterns, color palettes, and the language of art history.  
It’s slow progress, but deeply grounding.

Some mornings I barely glance at the painting; other mornings I linger.  
Either way, that small act reminds me that the world is vast — and art is one of the best ways to see it.
