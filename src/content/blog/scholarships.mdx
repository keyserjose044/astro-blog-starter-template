# 🎓 The Civil Engineering Scholarship Sheet — Funding My Dreams with Google Sheets

This is my **Scholarship Tracker** — the Google Sheet that helped me go from uncertainty to opportunity.  
It’s the same one that I used to apply for everything possible, leading to **8 scholarships** — all with a humble **3.0 GPA**.

The secret wasn’t luck or connections. It was organization, persistence, and a spreadsheet.

## 💡 The Problem: So Many Scholarships, So Little Clarity

When I first started applying, I kept losing track of **deadlines**, **essay prompts**, and which ones I had already completed.  
Some needed 250 words, others 1000; some wanted videos, some just a form. It was chaos.

That’s when I realized: I needed a **central hub**.

So, being an engineer at heart, I built one — a spreadsheet that listed:
- Due dates and award amounts  
- Essay prompts and requirements  
- Frequency (annual, biannual, monthly)  
- Quick links to every source site  

It quickly evolved into a **visual system** — part planner, part motivational dashboard.

## 🧱 Building the First Version (V1–V2)

I built the first version during undergrad at **UT Arlington**.  
It was simple, with bold yellow headers and links to sites like Bold.org, Chegg, and SuperCollege.  
The goal was straightforward: **collect every opportunity** that remotely applied to me.

Within months, I realized the power of consistency.  
Even if I didn’t win one, I reused essays, refined them, and reapplied.

## 🚀 LifeLoggerz Upgrade (V3)

By 2025, I wanted to share it with others — not just civil engineers, but anyone who wants to take control of their financial future.  
So I rebranded it under **LifeLoggerz**, modernized the design, and added functionality:
- Clearer due dates and color-coded cells  
- More scholarship sources and updated links  
- Highlighted essay requirements for quick scanning  
- Inspirational quotes and visuals (because spreadsheets can motivate too)

Now it’s not just a tracker — it’s a **roadmap to funding your education**.

## 🧩 Inside the Sheet

Here’s what you’ll find in the **LifeLoggerz Civil Engineering Scholarship Sheet**:

| Column | Function |
|--------|-----------|
| **A** | Due date — formatted chronologically |
| **B** | Scholarship name (hyperlinked to website) |
| **C** | Frequency (Annually, Monthly, etc.) |
| **D** | Award amount |
| **E** | Word or character limit |
| **F** | Essay prompt or special requirements |

Each row represents an opportunity — one potential “yes” in a sea of maybes.  
The sheet’s layout makes it easy to scan, filter, and plan applications weeks in advance.

## 💬 My Approach: Apply to Everything

I stopped overthinking which ones I’d “qualify” for.  
Instead, I told myself: **apply to everything possible.**

Some required essays, some didn’t. Some were local, others national.  
I reused paragraphs, kept a folder of my best responses, and treated it like a part-time job.

And slowly, the rejections turned into results.

---

## 🏆 The Results

Eight scholarships later, I realized that **persistence > perfection**.

Even with a 3.0 GPA, I was competing — and winning — simply because I showed up consistently.  
Every time I sent in another essay, I was stacking the odds in my favor.

This sheet was my scoreboard — each row a chance to move forward.

---

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

1. **Recycling works.**  
   Reuse and refine your best essays — most prompts overlap thematically.

2. **Organization beats overwhelm.**  
   With all scholarships in one place, you don’t waste time searching.

3. **You don’t need perfect grades.**  
   Scholarships reward stories, persistence, and potential — not perfection.

4. **Treat it like an engineering problem.**  
   Inputs: time and effort.  
   Outputs: free education and momentum.
