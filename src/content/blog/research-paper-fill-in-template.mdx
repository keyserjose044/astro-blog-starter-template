## What this template is
A one-page structure for **fast, repeatable** research notes so you can skim later and still recover key details.

## Who it's for
- Grad students and researchers summarizing many papers weekly  
- Anyone building a unified literature database

## Sections at a glance
- **Header row** — citation, authors, venue, page count, date read  
- **Abstract box** — 3–6 bullet summary of the *paper’s* abstract in your own words  
- **Problem / Solution** — single-line statement each  
- **Methods / Materials** — quick list; include test conditions  
- **Standards / Metrics** — ASTM, ISO, variables, units  
- **Results (icons row)** — heat-map or short bullets for each result bucket  
- **Key takeaways** — 2–4 bullets you want to remember next month

## How to fill it (quick workflow)
1. **Skim–scan:** title, abstract, figs, conclusion.  
2. **Write 5 bullets** (no sentences).  
3. **Log standards/metrics** you’ll reuse across papers.  
4. **Capture 2–4 takeaways** (what would you tell past-you?).  
5. **File link** (Zotero/Drive) + add your index ID.

- **Word version** (if you add one later)

## Tips
- Keep bullets terse; the template is a **compression** tool.  
- Use the same abbreviations across papers.  
- Snap a phone photo of handwritten pages and file it next to the PDF.

## Changelog
- **v1.0 (Oct 2025)** – Initial public release
