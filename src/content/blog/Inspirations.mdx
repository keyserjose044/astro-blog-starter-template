## ⚡ Efficiency Is Everything {#efficiency}

[Efficiency Is Everything](https://efficiencyiseverything.com) was one of the first blogs that changed how I thought about time and optimization.  
The guy tells you the cheapest foods per calorie, how much time you lose on simple tasks, and much more.  
This mindset **kindled my rush to save time**, since we all only have 24 hours a day.

## 🎥 Phil Von Stade — The Original Life Logger {#phil}

I thought I invented life-logging until I found this guy.  
Here’s a [Phil Von Stade video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPwZ-5M6XKw) from over 16 years ago — he tracked his life before it was cool.

## 🏊 Michael Phelps and Journaling {#phelps}

Even athletes do it.  
I read an [article about Michael Phelps](https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/michael-phelps-journaling-habits.html) and realized he’s been journaling for years.  

You know what the Google Sheet system has over plain journaling?  
- You can **Ctrl+F** for specific things.  
- You can **see the data over time**.  
- A year can be analyzed in minutes — and you still have your logs.

## 📱 Perfice — Track Your Life in an App {#perfice}

[Perfice](https://www.perfice.com) is a neat life-tracking app. I could build something like this, but for now I enjoy the **interactivity of my Google Sheets systems**.  
You see your data face-first — not hidden behind tabs or UI layers.

## 🎨 Feltron’s 2013 Annual Report {#feltron}

Nicholas Felton’s [2013 Life Report](https://feltron.com/FAR13.html) blew my mind.  
The graphic design presentation of his data is beautiful — minimal, statistical, poetic.  

Feel free to improve my systems in the **aesthetics department**.  
I haven’t delved into Looker Studio or Power BI yet, but that’s coming.

## 🌱 Raptitude — Experiments in Living Better {#raptitude}

[Raptitude](https://www.raptitude.com) inspired me to test self-improvement like experiments.  
My blog isn’t just about data — it’s about **improving workflows, free time, and ultimately, life**.

## 📊 Quantified Self Movement {#qs}

The [Quantified Self](https://quantifiedself.com) community shows what’s possible when people track everything.  
It’s not just numbers; it’s **awareness turned into action**.

## 💬 Final Thoughts

You think you can do better?  
Try using **Looker Studio**, **Power BI**, or tools I haven’t even touched yet.  
I avoid biometrics for now — there’s still plenty to optimize manually.

When I was younger, I kept stacks of notes and whiteboards trying to organize ideas.  
It was chaos.  
In **January 2023**, I began logging stats in Google Sheets.  
By **July 2023**, I realized I could **organize my entire mind in Excel** —  
and from that moment, LifeLoggerz began.

*Thanks to every creator who pushed me to quantify life itself.*
