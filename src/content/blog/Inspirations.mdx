# 🌟 LifeLoggerz Inspirations

The point of *LifeLoggerz* isn’t just to show what I track — it’s to show **why** I started doing it in the first place.  
Here are the people, projects, and philosophies that pushed me down this rabbit hole of data and discipline.

## ⚡ Efficiency Is Everything

[Efficiency Is Everything](https://efficiencyiseverything.com) was one of the first blogs that changed how I thought about time and optimization.  
The creator breaks down things like the **cheapest foods per calorie**, and how much time you lose on daily tasks.  

This mindset **kindled my rush to save time**, since we all only have 24 hours a day.

## 🎥 Phil Von Stade — The Original Life Logger

I thought I invented life-logging until I found [Phil Von Stade’s video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPwZ-5M6XKw) from over 16 years ago.  
He was tracking his entire life long before spreadsheets went viral — a pioneer of quantified living before it even had a name.

## 🏊 Michael Phelps and Journaling

Even world-class athletes do it.  
After reading [this article about Michael Phelps](https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/michael-phelps-journaling-habits.html), I realized he’s been journaling for years.

You know what Google Sheets has over journaling?

- You can **Ctrl + F** for specific thoughts or entries.  
- You can **see the data evolve** over time.  
- A full year can be analyzed in minutes — and you still have every log.

That’s when I knew structured journaling could become something bigger.

## 📱 Perfice — Tracking Life as an App

[Perfice](https://www.perfice.com) is a clean, minimal life-tracking app.  
I could build something similar one day — but for now, I enjoy the **interactivity and transparency** of my Google Sheets systems.  
You see your data face-first — not buried in menus or dashboards.

## 🎨 Feltron’s 2013 Annual Report

Nicholas Felton’s [2013 Life Report](https://feltron.com/FAR13.html) blew my mind.  
The design, typography, and storytelling made raw data feel **alive**.  

Feel free to improve on my systems in the **aesthetics department**.  
I haven’t explored Looker Studio or Power BI yet, but visual storytelling is high on my list for future upgrades.

## 🌱 Raptitude — Experiments in Living Better

[Raptitude](https://www.raptitude.com) inspired me to view self-improvement as a series of **experiments**.  
It’s not about perfection; it’s about iteration.  

My blog isn’t just about tracking — it’s about **improving workflows, free time, and ultimately life**.

---

## 📊 The Quantified Self Movement

The [Quantified Self](https://quantifiedself.com) community taught me what’s possible when people turn **awareness into numbers**.  
They showed that life-logging isn’t obsessive — it’s **reflective**.  
It’s not about collecting data for data’s sake, but using it to make better decisions.

## 💬 Final Thoughts

You think you can do better?  
Try Looker Studio, Power BI, or any tool I haven’t explored yet.  
I avoid deep biometrics for now — there’s still plenty to optimize manually.

When I was younger, I kept **stacks of notes** and filled whiteboards trying to organize ideas.  
It was chaos.  

In **January 2023**, I began logging simple stats in Google Sheets.  
By **July 2023**, I realized I could **organize my entire mind in Excel** —  
and that’s when *LifeLoggerz* truly began.

*Thanks to every creator who pushed me to quantify life itself.*
