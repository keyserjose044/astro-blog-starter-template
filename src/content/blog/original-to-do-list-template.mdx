## 🗓️ What It Is

The **Weekly To-Do List Template** is a simple yet powerful layout designed for tracking tasks across the week while keeping long-term projects and personal goals in sight.  
Each section gives you just enough space to stay intentional without feeling cluttered.

## 🧭 Template Overview

Now before we get into the specifics, know that the template is a **customizable .docx file**. 

You see those little icons at the bottom left/center? You can change those out for other things. 
Those are for your **Hobbies**. Ever find yourself wondering what to do next? Look here.

Also, the images above the 'Projects/Goals'? Those are the **things you're grateful for**.

And then there's the image of **[Phileas Fogg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phileas_Fogg)** at the bottom right corner. Change this to whoever inspires you most.

Plenty of room for making the template your own.

Now, onto functionality:

### 📅 Days of the Week
Seven daily panels — **Monday through Sunday** — each with lines to record:
- Top priorities or to-dos (central space)
- Short notes or reminders (under each date entry)

This format helps visualize the flow of your week and spot overloaded days early.

### 📅 Reminders
Got something goin' on in a few weeks? A big trip 3 months from now? Tasks that you haven't decided an exact time for? **Keep these reminders to the right of the page**.

### 🎯 Projects & Goals
A dedicated box at the bottom right corner of the page:
- **Projects:** Ongoing work, study, or creative tasks that won't be done any time soon.  
- **Goals:** Personal or professional objectives you want to keep in mind. 

Use this space for higher-level direction, not day-to-day errands.

## 🧠 How to Use It

1. **Print a fresh sheet each week** — or duplicate digitally in OneNote, Notability, or Google Docs.  
2. Start your week by filling in the **Projects/Goals** first.
3. Add key tasks and reminders to each day — aim for no more than *3–5 high-impact items*.  
4. At week’s end, review what got done, what slipped, and carry over remaining items.
