# 🎼 Conquering the Western Classical Canon — One Composer at a Time

I started listening to composers one by one in **November 2024**, in a bid to find the best music ever written — thank goodness for technological advances that bring *all the music ever composed* into your living room.  

I'm a musically untrained enthusiast with minimal theoretical background, but an ever-growing curiosity. My goal is simple: to one day return to my favorites and analyze them with a composer’s insight once I’m initiated into the dark arts of music theory.

## 🎩 1. The Haydn Experiment

It all began after reading a blog post by someone who listened to all **104 of Haydn’s symphonies**.  
Inspired, I decided to do the same. The *Farewell Symphony*, *La Chasse*, and *La Poule* already held a special place in my heart, so I figured: *why not listen to them all and find more favorites?*

From Haydn, I began hopping between composers — Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Brahms — before realizing that my early approach (listening to *every single work* of a composer before moving on) led to fatigue.  

So I evolved the system: instead of completionism, I now focus on **major works** — the pieces that define a composer’s voice.

## 📊 2. Quantifying the Canon

As of this post — nearly a year since I began — I’ve listened to **486 hours** of classical music spanning **34 composers**.  
Most of this listening happens during research or writing sessions, where the music doubles as both inspiration and focus.

Each composer’s listening period is logged in Google Sheets — every date, piece title, and duration contributes to a living dataset that reflects not just what I’ve heard, but *when and how intensely* I explored it.

## 🧾 3. The Google Sheets System

Here’s how the sheet works:

- **Date & Piece Title** — entered manually when I listen  
- **Composer, Genre, Form, Movement, Year** — fetched automatically using ChatGPT API via Apps Script at midnight  
- **Length & Rating** — duration in hours, and my rating (Ok, Nice, Great, Amazing, or Gorgeous)

When I feel like listening to something random, I simply filter for *Amazing* or *Gorgeous* and choose one at random — guaranteed to move me.

## 🗂 4. Two Complementary Systems — Sheets & Raindrop

To complement the spreadsheet, I built a **Raindrop collection** that serves as a visual gallery.  
While Google Sheets handles numbers, hours, and categories, Raindrop displays album covers and playlists — turning data into something *beautifully browsable*.

- **Google Sheets** → for stats, totals, and dynamic trends  
- **Raindrop** → for the visual archive of every recording I’ve enjoyed  

Together, they create a complete ecosystem: analytical and aesthetic, structured yet emotional — the LifeLoggerz way.

## ⏳ 5. Evolving the Listening Journey

Initially, I planned to finish the Western Canon composer by composer, in order.  
Now, I’m taking a **chronological-thematic** route — for example:

- Baroque → Bach, Vivaldi, Handel, Corelli  
- Classical → Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven  
- Romantic → Schubert, Brahms, Tchaikovsky, Mahler  
- Modern → Debussy, Ravel, Stravinsky  

Currently, I’m exploring the **Italian Baroque**, dissecting how early textures evolved into Classical structure. It’s the musical equivalent of tracing the genealogy of civilization itself.

## 💡 6. Lessons from a Year of Listening

- **Patterns emerge** — my attention span and emotional engagement vary by era and orchestration.  
- **Productivity correlations** — faster tempos boost work output; adagios enhance focus.  
- **Rediscovery** — favorites change when revisited months later, mirroring my evolving taste.

What started as a listening experiment became a mirror — one reflecting not just composers’ evolution, but my own intellectual and emotional growth.

## 🎶 Final Thoughts

Listening to the *entire Western Canon* might be impossible — but it’s the pursuit that matters.  
Every hour logged and every spreadsheet cell filled represents both *discipline* and *delight*.

> “The deeper you go into art, the more you learn about yourself.”  
> — *LifeLoggerz*

The next frontier: connecting my listening data to my **Google Sheets analytics**, so that each month’s total listening time and top composers auto-populate my LifeLoggerz dashboard.

Stay tuned — this is just **Movement I: Allegro**.
