## 🧭 Site, Occupancy, and Plan

- **Occupancy**: Hospital (higher importance / risk category).  
- **Location**: Kerrville, Texas.  
- **Loading standard**: ASCE 7 for gravity and wind, ACI 318 for reinforced-concrete design.

The plan has two main wings running in the “B” direction and a central spine. Both overall dimensions are:

- A = 125 ft  
- B = 125 ft  

There is also a **cantilever balcony** on all floors on one side of the building.

🧱 Structural Layout (Second-Floor “Design Ceiling”)

The project instructions ask us to:

    Choose a column, beam, joist, and slab layout such that at least one slab is two-way.
    Make sure the column is slender.

    Assume one beam on the designated floor is precast and rests on corbels.

    Provide detailed hand calculations only for the corbel, while the other members can be designed using software.

What we chose

    Slab: 8-in cast-in-place RC slab.

        At least one interior panel has Ly/Lx ≤ 2, so it can be designed as a two-way slab.

    Beams / Joists:

        Primary beams along the main grid lines.

        Secondary beams or joists in the short direction to reduce slab spans.

    Columns: 18 in × 18 in.

        Story height = 18 ft → slenderness ratio is large enough to consider slender column effects.

    Precast beam:

        One beam on the second floor is taken as precast.

        Its end reactions at columns are carried by reinforced concrete corbels.

Alternate beam design

For extra comparison, we define an alternate design where the beam width and depth are interchanged. For example:

    Base: 12 in wide × 24 in deep

    Alternate: 24 in wide × 12 in deep

We use the analysis program (RISA or ETABS) to see how this affects:

    Bending moments and shears

    Deflections and drift

    Required reinforcement and overall weight

📦 Loads (Conceptual Summary)

The detailed numbers live in the project report; here is the structure of what was used:

    Dead load (DL)

        Slab self-weight (8 in RC)

        Superimposed dead load: partitions, ceiling, mechanical, finishes

    Live load (LL)

        Hospital occupancy loads from ASCE 7 (patient areas, corridors, etc.)

    Roof loads

        Roof dead load

        Roof live load or snow (as required)

    Wind loads

        Directional wind pressures in X and Y per ASCE 7

        Applied as lateral loads at each floor level

All of these are combined in standard strength and service combinations such as:

    1.2 DL + 1.6 LL

    1.2 DL + 1.0 LL + 1.0 Wind

    0.9 DL ± 1.0 Wind

These combinations are defined directly in the analysis software.
🧮 Analysis Workflow (RISA / ETABS)
1. Build the model

    3 stories, each 18 ft high

    Column lines and bay dimensions taken from the architectural plan (A = B = 125 ft)

    Beams assigned along grid lines; slab as a 8-in thick plate or as equivalent frame, depending on the software workflow

2. Assign member properties

    Columns: 18 in × 18 in

    Beams: base dimensions (for example, 12×24 in)

    Slab: 8 in thick

    Alternate model: same geometry but beam sections have b and h swapped

3. Apply loads

    Area loads on slabs for DL and LL

    Roof loads on top level

    Wind loads as equivalent lateral forces at floor levels

4. Run analysis

The main outputs of interest for the second floor (our “design ceiling”) are:

    Design moments MxMx​ and MyMy​ in the critical two-way slab panel

    Envelope bending moments and shears in the critical beams

    Axial force and biaxial bending in the critical columns

    The factored end reaction of the precast beam at the corbel support

📐 Design of Critical Members (Second Floor)

Even though only the corbel requires full hand calculations, it is still important to show that the other members are properly designed.
Two-Way Slab

For the chosen interior panel:

    Use the program’s strip design results, or apply the Direct Design / Equivalent Frame Method.

    From factored design moments in each direction (Mx and My), compute steel areas using standard beam design formulas.

    Provide top and bottom reinforcement in each direction, including negative steel over supports and positive steel at midspan.

Beams

For the critical second-floor beam:

    Take the maximum positive and negative factored bending moments from the analysis.

    Compute the required steel area As from:

        As ≈ Mu / (phi * fy * jd) for a quick check, or

        The more exact rectangular-stress-block relation if needed.

    Check shear with Vu and design stirrups accordingly.

    Confirm serviceability (deflection) using span-to-depth and software deflection output.

Columns

For a critical second-floor column:

    From the model, obtain Pu (factored axial load) and bending moments about both axes.

    Use ACI column interaction diagrams (charts or software) to determine the required longitudinal steel ratio.

    Specify bar pattern and tie spacing, ensuring code minimums are satisfied.

    Note that with an 18-ft story height and 18-in column, slenderness effects may need to be considered (moment magnification).

These designs are summarized in the report and drawings; the corbel design below is shown in full detail.
🧷 Hand-Designed Corbel Supporting a Precast Beam

One of the second-floor beams is modeled as precast. At each supporting column the beam’s end reaction is carried by a reinforced concrete corbel.

The analysis model gives:

    Factored vertical reaction at the corbel:

        Vu (kips) at a distance a (inches) from the column face

    The vertical dimension h of the corbel (for example, 18 in)

    The column / corbel width bw (for example, 14 in)

We assume a small horizontal tension force at the top of the corbel, Nuc, to account for effects such as creep and shrinkage between the beam and column.

    Note: In the classroom example this horizontal force was taken as
    Nuc = 0.2 × (service dead reaction) × 1.6.
    The same approach can be used here, or as directed by the instructor.

Below is the design checklist for the corbel.
1) Geometry and Applicability

    Choose corbel overall depth h (for example, 18 in).

    Place the main tension steel approximately 1 in from the top surface → effective depth d ≈ h − 1 in.

    Check:

        a / d < 1.0

        Depth of concrete at the corbel face under the bearing plate ≥ 0.5 d

If these are satisfied, the ACI 318 corbel provisions are applicable.
2) Concrete Shear Limit

The code places an upper bound on the nominal shear strength Vn. Compute these three expressions:

    V1 = 0.2 × f'c × bw × d

    V2 = 1600 × bw × d

    V3 = (480 + 0.08 × f'c) × bw × d

Use f'c in psi, bw and d in inches, giving V in pounds.
The smallest of V1, V2, V3 is Vn,max.

Check:

    phi × Vn,max ≥ Vu

with phi = 0.75 for shear in this region.
3) Shear-Friction Steel Avf

To provide shear transfer across the corbel–column interface, we use the shear-friction concept:

    Take coefficient of friction μ = 1.4 for a monolithically cast interface.

    Required shear-friction steel area:

        Avf = Vu / (phi × μ × fy)

This area is usually provided by the same bars that serve as the main tension reinforcement, as long as they cross the assumed shear-friction plane and are properly anchored.
4) Factored Moment at Column Face

The corbel behaves like a short cantilever. The design moment at the column face is:

    Mu = Vu × a + Nuc × (h − d)

The second term is often small if h − d is about 1 in, but it is included for completeness.
5) Flexural Steel for Mu (Af)

For a quick and accurate classroom design, the required steel ratio can be approximated as:

    ρ ≈ Mu / (phi × fy × bw × d²)

where:

    Mu is in in-kips (convert to in-lb if needed),

    bw and d are in inches,

    fy is in psi,

    phi is the flexural strength reduction factor (often 0.9 for flexure, or 0.75 in some corbel examples).

Then:

    Af = ρ × bw × d

Af is the steel area needed to resist the bending moment.
6) Extra Steel for Horizontal Tension (An)

To resist the axial tension Nuc at the top:

    An = Nuc / (phi × fy)

This area is added to the flexural requirement.
7) Total Main Steel Asc

ACI requires the total main tension steel Asc to be at least the largest of three expressions:

    Af + An

    (2 / 3) × Avf + An

    0.04 × (f'c / fy) × bw × d

Compute all three, then take:

    Asc,required = maximum of (1, 2, 3)

Choose a convenient bar arrangement (for example 2 #6 bars, or 3 #7 bars) such that:

    Asc,provided ≥ Asc,required

These bars run near the top of the corbel, welded or otherwise anchored to the bearing plate or angle at the tip and extended into the column.
8) Closed Hoops (Ah)

The corbel also needs closed hoop reinforcement whose legs are parallel to the main tension bars.
ACI gives:

    Ah = 0.5 × (Asc − An)

Important detail: for each closed stirrup, both legs parallel to the main bars count.
For example, a #3 bar has area 0.11 in².
One closed #3 hoop has two such legs → 0.22 in² contributing to Ah.

Provide enough hoops such that:

    Ah,provided ≥ Ah,required

Place these hoops within approximately the upper two-thirds of the depth measured from the tension steel. Spacings around 3 to 4 in are typical.
Small “framing bars” in the corner can be added to improve anchorage and detailing.
9) Development and Anchorage of Main Bars

The main bars must develop their tensile force within the column:

    Use ACI development-length rules for hooked bars in tension.

    For a given bar size and f'c = 5 ksi, a tabulated basic hooked-bar development length can be used (for example, values from CRSI or design aids).

    If the provided steel area is greater than required, ACI allows the development length to be reduced in proportion (down to a prescribed minimum factor).

In practice, this means extending the bars well into the column with a standard 90-degree hook and ensuring enough straight length plus hook is available inside the column core.
10) Bearing Under the Plate

Finally, check that the bearing plate does not overstress the concrete:

    Let A1 be the area of the bearing plate in contact with the concrete.

    Let A2 be the effective supporting area behind that bearing (often the column area under the plate).

    Nominal bearing strength:

        Pn = 0.85 × f'c × A1 × sqrt(A2 / A1)

    Design strength: phi × Pn, with phi for bearing (commonly 0.65 or as specified).

Check:

    phi × Pn ≥ Vu

If needed, adjust the plate size or provide local confinement.

Plate thickness and welds/anchors are then checked using simple steel design principles.
🔁 Alternate Beam Design: Width/Depth Swapped

To earn extra credit and compare performance, an alternate model is created where beam width and depth are interchanged:

    Example: 12 in wide × 24 in deep → 24 in wide × 12 in deep

For this scheme:

    Re-run the analysis.

    Compare:

        Bending moments and shears

        Required steel in beams and columns

        Floor deflections and overall drift

        Self-weight and approximate cost

    Note any changes in the precast beam end reaction and comment on how sensitive the corbel design is to those changes.

This comparison goes into the project report and can be summarized in a small table in the blog post.

On the website, this post serves as the readable, story-like version of that design process, answering the question:

    “Is this 3-story hospital in Kerrville structurally sound?”

The short answer: Yes—provided the members and corbel are detailed and constructed according to the design shown here and in the full report.


If you’d like, next I can:

- Help you make a **tiny comparison table** (baseline vs alternate beam sections) to paste into the post once you have RISA/ETABS results, or  
- Draft a separate short page just for the **corbel hand-calc PDF** with download links.
