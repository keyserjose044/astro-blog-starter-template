# 🏥 3-Story Hospital Opening in Kerrville, TX — Is it Structurally Sound?

This post documents our structural concept and design workflow for a **3-story hospital** in **Kerrville, Texas**. We outline the building geometry, loading, analysis approach (ETABS/RISA), the **critical member designs** for the second-floor ceiling (slab, beams, columns), and include **hand calculations for a reinforced-concrete corbel** supporting a **precast beam**—the item required for hand submission.

> **Specs at a Glance**
>
> - Plan: **A = 125 ft**, **B = 125 ft** (see plan below)  
> - Stories: **3** (story height **18 ft**)  
> - System: Cast-in-place RC frame with one **two-way slab** panel, precast beam supported on **corbels**  
> - Materials: **f’c = 5 ksi**, **fy = 60 ksi**  
> - Location: **Kerrville, TX** (hospital risk category, wind per ASCE 7)  
> - **Alternate design**: swap beam **width/depth** and compare

## 🧱 Structural Layout (Second-Floor “Design Ceiling”)

- **Slab system**: 8-in RC slab; select at least one **interior panel** with Ly/Lx ≤ 2 and design as **two-way**.  
- **Beams/joists**: Primary beams on column lines; secondary beams/joists framing into primaries.  
- **Columns**: 18 in × 18 in at grid intersections. Slender by geometry (18-ft story).  
- **Precast beam**: Selected line on the second floor rests on **RC corbels** at columns.

> **Alternate Scheme:** Interchange beam **b** and **h** (e.g., 12×24 ↔ 24×12) and re-run analysis to compare weight, deflection, and demand/capacity ratios.

---

## 📦 Loads (summary)

You noted full load derivations in the report. Here we list what’s applied in the model:

- **Dead Load (DL)**: slab self-weight + superimposed dead (partitions, ceilings, MEP).  
- **Live Load (LL)**: per hospital occupancies.  
- **Roof**: DL + roof LL (or snow if applicable).  
- **Wind**: ASCE 7 (directional cases X/Y; include ± for pressures).  
- **Combos**: Strength and service combinations per ASCE 7 / ACI 318.

*(In the model we apply area loads to slabs and let tributary loads flow to beams/columns. The precast beam end reaction from the 2nd floor is used directly in the corbel design below.)*

---

## 🧮 Analysis Workflow (ETABS/RISA)

1. **Geometry**: 3 stories @ 18 ft; grid/bays per plan.  
2. **Sections**: Columns 18×18; beams (baseline); **Alt** model with b/h swapped; slab 8 in.  
3. **Loads**: Assign DL/LL/roof/wind; define load **combinations**.  
4. **Run**: Extract for the **2nd floor**:
   - **Slab panel** design moments \(M_x, M_y\) for the selected two-way panel.  
   - **Beam** envelopes \(M_u, V_u\) (pick the **critical** beam).  
   - **Column** envelopes \(P_u, M_{ux}, M_{uy}\) (pick a **critical** column).  
   - **Precast beam end reaction** at corbel: \(V_u^{(corbel)}\) and eccentricity \(a\).

5. **Design**:
   - Slab (two-way): Direct Design / EFM or software design strips → top/bottom steel in both directions.  
   - Beams: Flexure (top/bot steel), shear (stirrups), deflection check.  
   - Columns: Axial-moment via interaction diagram; tie spacing; slenderness effects per ACI.  
   - **Corbel**: full hand calc (next section).

## 🧷 Hand Calculation — Corbel Supporting a Precast Beam

**Goal:** Design one **RC corbel** at a 2nd-floor column supporting the precast beam’s **factored end reaction**.

> **Given/From Model**
> - \( V_u = \) *(take from analysis)* kips acting at \( a = \) *(in.)* from column face  
> - Assume horizontal tension from creep/shrinkage at top: \( N_{uc} = 0.2D \times 1.6 \) (or per instructor convention)  
> - Materials: \( f'_{c} = 5 \) ksi, \( f_y = 60 \) ksi  
> - Corbel width \(b_w\) = column width (e.g., 14 in). Choose **h** (≈ 18 in) so that \(d \approx h - 1\) in.
> - Bearing plate (e.g., 12"×6"): check bearing capacity afterward.

### 1) Applicability & Geometry
- Check \( a/d < 1.0 \) and **depth at face ≥ 0.5d** (ACI 16.5.1–16.5.2).  
- Choose slope/geometry so face depth satisfies the 0.5d requirement.

### 2) Concrete Shear Limit (cap on \(V_n\))
Smallest of:
\[
\begin{aligned}
&0.2 f'_c b_w d,\quad 1600\,b_w d,\quad (480 + 0.08f'_c) b_w d \\
&\Rightarrow \phi V_n^{\max} = 0.75 \times \min(\cdot) \ge V_u
\end{aligned}
\]

### 3) Shear-Friction Steel \(A_{vf}\) (ACI 22.9)
\[
A_{vf} = \frac{V_u}{\phi \mu f_y},\quad \mu = 1.4 \text{ (monolithic)}
\]

### 4) Moment at Column Face
\[
M_u = V_u a + N_{uc}(h - d)
\]

### 5) Flexural Steel for Moment \(A_f\)
Quick, accurate classroom form:
\[
\rho \approx \frac{M_u}{\phi f_y b_w d^2}\quad\Rightarrow\quad A_f = \rho b_w d
\]
(Alternative exact form available if needed.)

### 6) Extra Steel for \(N_{uc}\)
\[
A_n = \frac{N_{uc}}{\phi f_y}
\]

### 7) Total Main Steel \(A_{sc}\) (take the **largest**)
\[
A_{sc} \ge \max\!\left(
A_f + A_n,\;
\frac{2}{3}A_{vf} + A_n,\;
0.04 \frac{f'_c}{f_y} b_w d
\right)
\]
→ **Provide** bars (e.g., 2#6, 3#7, etc.) near top; weld/anchor at the tip.

### 8) Closed Hoops (ties) Parallel to Main Bars
\[
A_h = 0.5(A_{sc} - A_n)
\]
Count **both legs** of each closed hoop that are parallel to \(A_{sc}\).  
Place within **\(2/3\,d\)** from the tension steel; s ≈ 3–4 in typical. Add small framing bars at the inside corner for anchorage.

### 9) Development/Anchorage
Use ACI hooked-bar provisions (tension, top bar) for chosen size; provide embedment into the column (often 40–56 in range depending on size/cover/position/tables). If providing excess steel, apply the permitted reduction factor.

### 10) Bearing Under Plate (Concrete)
\[
\phi P_n \ge V_u,\qquad
P_n = 0.85 f'_c A_1 \sqrt{A_2/A_1}
\]
Check \(A_1 =\) plate area; \(A_2 =\) effective supporting area behind bearing per ACI.  
Also check plate thickness/anchor welds (steel design).

> **Deliverable**: Include a neat calc sheet showing inputs from ETABS ( \(V_u, a\) ), your chosen geometry \(h,d,b_w\), and each step above with bar callouts and a detailing sketch.

## 🔁 Alternate Design (Beam b/h Swapped)

Re-run the model with beam **width/depth interchanged**. Compare:

- **Demands** \(M_u, V_u\), **deflections**, and **drift**  
- Member **capacities / required steel**  
- **Self-weight** and **constructability** (formwork, bar congestion)  
- Any change in the **precast beam end reactions** → updated **corbel** demand (brief sensitivity note)

Summarize in a small table/graphic.

---

## 📐 Drawing & Detailing Package

- **Plans**: second-floor framing + grid.  
- **Sections**: typical beam/slab and column zones.  
- **Corbel detail**: bar sizes, weld note, hoop spacing, development, bearing plate.  
- **General notes**: materials, design codes, load criteria, rebar specs, cover, tolerances.

---

## 📊 Results & Conclusion

- Slab, beam, column designs meet ACI strength and serviceability.  
- Corbel hand design demonstrates adequate strength and anchorage for the precast reaction at the 2nd floor.  
- Alternate scheme trade-offs (stiffness/weight/demand) are discussed; recommend **[choose winning scheme]** for final.
