# 🏥 3-Story Reinforced Concrete Hospital in Kerrville, TX — Final Structural Design Summary

This post summarizes the major outcomes of our structural analysis and design of a **three-story reinforced concrete hospital** located in Kerrville, Texas. The work was completed using **ETABS modeling**, **ACI 318-19 provisions**, and **ASCE 7-22** load requirements.

This facility is an **essential structure (Risk Category IV)**, which governs its loading, lateral system selection, and reliability expectations. The full engineering report covers member design, lateral mechanics, serviceability, and a hand-designed reinforced-concrete corbel.

## 📍 Site, Function, and Construction

- **Location:** Kerrville, Texas — low seismicity, Exposure B wind terrain  
- **Total floors:** 3  
- **Story height:** 18 ft → total building height 54 ft  
- **Construction type:** I-A (noncombustible RC)  
- **Use:** Full-scale hospital with patient rooms, ICU, surgery, labs  

Each floor uses an **8-inch reinforced two-way slab** acting as a rigid diaphragm, transferring loads efficiently to columns and shear walls. Columns throughout are **18 in × 18 in**, using **5000-psi concrete** and **Grade-60 steel**.

## 📐 Building Layout & Lateral System

- **First floor:** emergency care & imaging  
- **Second floor:** surgery & intensive care  
- **Third floor:** inpatient rooms & admin  

An elevator core participates in lateral resistance. The hybrid system uses **moment-resisting RC frames** in one direction and **shear walls** in the other.

**Wind-induced drift:**
- Max story drift = **0.42 in**
- Limit for essential facilities = **0.96 in**
- Performance = **~44% of allowable** (excellent stiffness)

## 📦 Loading & Design Standards

All loads follow **ASCE 7-22**; design provisions follow **ACI 318-19**.

### Gravity Loads
- **Floor dead load:** 139 psf  
- **Live load (patient areas):** 100 psf (non-reducible)

### Wind Loads
- **Basic wind speed:** 99 mph  
- **Enhanced (Risk Category IV):** 115 mph  
- Story pressures applied directionally in ETABS

### Seismic Loads
- Kerrville = **very low seismicity**
- **Seismic Design Category:** A/B  
- **Seismic effects did not govern**

---

## 🧮 ETABS Modeling & Critical Member Identification

The second floor governed because of:
- cumulative gravity effects  
- diaphragm participation  

**Critical members identified:**
- Column C2 (second floor)  
- Beam B1 (adjacent to corbel)  
- Two-way slab strip  
- Corbel supporting a precast beam  

Linear-elastic analysis with cracked-section modifiers was used.

## 🔍 Member Design Highlights

### 🔸 Critical Column (C2)
- Section: **18 in × 18 in**
- Passed **Pu-Mu interaction**
- Adequate reinforcement for axial + biaxial bending

### 🔸 Critical Beam
- Baseline: **24 in × 18 in**
- Alternate: **18 in × 24 in**
- Result: negligible design change; effective depth varied

### 🔸 Slab Strip
- Rigid diaphragm action
- Minimum ACI steel satisfied
- Punching shear acceptable

## 🧷 Corbel Supporting Precast Beam — Hand Design

Designed using **ACI 318-19 Strut-and-Tie**.

**Final requirements:**
- Primary tension steel: **1.23 in² → 2-#8 bars**
- Shear friction steel: **0.48 in²**
- Closed confinement: **3-leg #3 hoops @ 6 in**
- Development length into column: **≈ 73 in**

A follow-up "AI-generated" design was produced, but its geometry was **not code-compliant**, so the hand design remained authoritative.

---

## 💡 Observations & Project Lessons

- Wind governed; seismic negligible  
- Diaphragm rigidity made internal force transfer clean  
- Hybrid system controlled drift effectively  
- Uniform sizes simplified design; optimization possible in real-world work

---

## 🔚 Conclusions

The final structural system:
- Meets **all strength and serviceability requirements**
- Performs **extremely well** under Risk Category IV wind
- Maintains **comfortable drift reserve**

Corbel design was the standout hands-on component, and ETABS results aligned cleanly with hand calculations.

> **Bottom line:** YES — it is structurally sound and achieves robust safety margins.
