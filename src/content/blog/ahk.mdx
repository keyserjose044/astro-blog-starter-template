# ⌨️ Building a One-Handed Productivity System with AutoHotkey

For the past year, I’ve been quietly building a productivity system that runs almost entirely from my **left hand on the keyboard**.

No mouse.  
No clicking through folders.  
No retyping the same phrases.

Just **16 simple AutoHotkey hotstrings** — all ending in `xx`.

With those alone, I can:

- Instantly arrange my workspaces  
- Teleport into project folders  
- Launch full workflows  
- Paste smart boilerplate with live inputs  
- Trigger advanced ChatGPT prompt menus  
- Summarize conversations in one keystroke  

This post breaks down the breakthroughs behind the system — and how anyone can build something similar.
