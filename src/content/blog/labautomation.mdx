# ⚙️ Lab Automation — Turning Months of Manual Work Into Minutes

Between May and July 2025, I built something that completely changed the way I work in the lab.

I started with **no formal coding experience** — just curiosity and determination.  
By the end of the summer, I had automated the data processing for **most of our lab machines**, cutting hours of repetitive work down to a few minutes.

Now, what once took me two hours — downloading raw data, formatting Excel tables, calculating results, plotting graphs — takes just **3–5 minutes**.  
And it all began in **Thonny**, the simplest Python IDE I could find.

## 🧩 The Research Script Launcher

This app is called the **Research Script Launcher**.  
Each tile represents a piece of lab equipment — and behind each one lies a full Python workflow I built from scratch.

- **HOH** — Heat of Hydration (Isothermal Calorimetry)
- **TGA** — Thermogravimetric Analysis  
- **Load-CMOD** — Flexural Test Analysis  
- **Compression** — Compressive Strength Curves  
- **XRD**, **FTIR**, **UV-Vis**, **Raman**, **Zeta**, and others  

Click a button → The corresponding Python script runs → You get a clean, formatted Excel file and pre-styled graphs ready for PowerPoint.

No more copying formulas. No more replotting data.  
Just one click.

## 🔬 How It Works (Simplified)

Each Python script:
1. Reads raw data files from the machine (CSV, TXT, or Excel).
2. Processes the data — cleaning, calculating, and normalizing values.
3. Generates formatted Excel workbooks with multiple sheets:
   - Raw Data
   - Calculated Parameters
   - Mechanical Results
   - Averages and Summaries
4. Creates publication-ready graphs (colors, fonts, legends, etc.).
5. Opens the Excel file automatically once done.

Everything follows the same structure — modular, consistent, and human-proof.

## 💡 The Learning Curve

When I began in **May 2025**, I didn’t know how to write a function or a for-loop.  
I just knew what I wanted: *automation.*

Through trial, error, and a lot of late nights, I built code that:
- Communicated directly with instruments via **PyVISA**
- Generated Excel files with **Pandas** and **XlsxWriter**
- Designed GUIs with **CustomTkinter**
- Integrated plotting and formatting standards across projects

I wrote thousands of lines of code — and broke them thousands of times too.  
But by July, everything clicked.  

That feeling when the automation finally works?  
Unmatched.

## 🧠 Example Script — Simplified

Below is a simplified conceptual example of how one script works (not the actual code):

```python
def run_experiment(device):
    for freq in frequencies:
        r, x = device.measure(freq)
        data.append((freq, r, x))
    save_to_excel(data)
    plot_graphs(data)
```

Simple to look at, complex to perfect.
Each instrument required its own communication protocol, timing logic, and output structure — all unified through one design philosophy: make it effortless.
🧮 Time Saved = Time for Research

Before automation:

        2 hours per dataset

        Multiple Excel sheets

        Manual chart editing

        Risk of human error

After automation:

        3–5 minutes per dataset

        Fully formatted workbook

        Ready-to-insert graphs

        0% manual error

That’s not just convenience — that’s time reinvested into discovery.
🧰 The App Ecosystem

This launcher connects everything:

    HOH Analyzer → Reads calorimetry data and plots heat flow curves

    TGA Processor → Normalizes weight loss and derivative curves

    Load-CMOD Tool → Calculates flexural toughness, strength, and FCS

    Vicat Timer → Automates setting time reports

    Compression & Modulus Analyzer → Calculates strength/modulus, averages, and deviations

    Photo Scraper → Captures experimental photos for archiving

    To-Do Module → Personal research task tracker

Every machine, every dataset — unified under one interface.
🎓 Reflection

As a civil engineering PhD student, this was more than coding.
It was system design — applied to scientific research.

Every hour spent debugging Python is now saving me dozens each month.
And most importantly, it’s freeing me to focus on what really matters: understanding materials, not spreadsheets.
🚀 The Bigger Picture

This experience opened my eyes to how much manual academic work can be automated — especially in experimental research.

Data collection, cleaning, and graphing shouldn’t consume entire afternoons.
Automation gives researchers their time back.

Eventually, I plan to expand this into:

    Automated PowerPoint generation for reports

    Integration with Google Sheets dashboards

    Cross-lab usage tracking and data archiving
