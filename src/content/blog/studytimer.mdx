# ⏱ LifeLoggerz StudyTimer — Turning Focus into Feedback Loops

Every morning before diving into my research, I open a small dark-themed window titled **Study Timer**.
It sits quietly in the top-right corner of my screen, tracking time spent in deep work without internet, accounts, or distractions.

And when I cross a milestone — 15 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours — a little sound plays.
A meme. A cheer. A reward for focus.

This is **LifeLoggerz StudyTimer**, a minimalist app I wrote in **Python** using **CustomTkinter** and **Pygame** to turn long hours into *measurable, audible progress*.

## 🧩 1. Why I Built It

I needed something simple — something that:

* Tracks *exact* time spent actually working (excluding breaks)
* Logs timestamps for start, pause, resume, and finish
* Runs locally, even during Wi-Fi outages
* Feels *satisfying* instead of sterile

Most timers were either overbuilt or locked behind accounts and subscriptions.
So I wrote my own.

Now it’s the backbone of my **daily study routine** — every serious session starts here, and its logs flow into my productivity sheets later on.

## ⚙️ 2. The Interface

The UI is deliberately minimal: a big digital timer and a tight row of buttons underneath.

* **▶️ Start** — starts or resumes the session
* **⏸️ Pause** — pauses and records break start
* **✅ Done** — ends the session and shows a summary

Each button has a small tooltip that appears on hover (“Start or resume study”, “Pause study session”, etc.), which keeps things intuitive without adding clutter.

There’s also a **📌 Snap** button to pin the window in the top-right of the screen, and a **📊 Stats** button that opens a live stats panel with:

* Current study time
* Total break time
* Number of breaks
* Milestones hit
* A scrolling log of timestamps (Start / Pause / Resume / Done)

## 🎧 3. Victory Sounds & Milestones

The StudyTimer rewards consistency through **milestone sounds**.
Every time you cross a focus checkpoint — 1 minute, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, and so on — it checks if that milestone has already been hit. If not, it:

1. Plays a sound file (chime, meme, or music clip)
2. Flashes the timer text green for a second
3. Shows a short motivational message for about 10 seconds

Here’s a simplified version of the milestone map, written in plain Python:

```
milestones = {
    1:   ("ding-sound-effect_2.mp3", "🚦 We’re going!"),
    15:  ("success-chime.mp3", "✅ Nice pace!"),
    60:  ("bad-to-the-bone-meme.mp3", "🔥 You beast!"),
    120: ("vine-boom.mp3", "🚀 2 HOURS! LEGEND!"),
    300: ("heavenly-music-gaming-sound-effect.mp3", "🌟 5 HOURS! Demigod."),
    600: ("que-lindo-que-lindo-que-lindo-evaldo-jose-cbn.mp3", "🎯 10 HOURS! Beautiful!"),
}
```

Some of the messages you’ll see along the way:

> “💰 Stacking minutes!”
> “🙌 7 hours. Hallelujah!”
> “📈 Right on track.”

It’s a small dopamine loop, but it makes long sessions *feel* like progress instead of just clock time.

## 🧮 4. Ending a Session & Seeing the Summary

When you click **✅ Done**, the app asks if you’re sure and then compiles a clean summary using the timestamps it has been collecting:

```
🕐 Total Study Time: 2:47:13
☕ Total Break Time: 0:22:19
🔁 Number of Breaks: 3

⏱️ Timestamps:
Start: 8:32:01am
Break 1 Start: 9:15:02am
Break 1 Resume: 9:20:45am  (⏳ 0:05:43)
End: 11:19:14am
```

I usually **copy this summary** straight into my Google Sheets:

* Raw Data logs
* Daily Snapshot
* Weekly productivity review

Over time, that gives me a clear record of *when* I worked, *how long* I actually focused, and *how many breaks* I took.

## 🧠 5. Building Flow through Feedback

StudyTimer isn’t about grinding; it’s about **acknowledging focus**.

* 🎵 The *audio feedback* makes progress tangible
* 📊 The *stats window* keeps you honest about breaks
* 🧘 The *minimal UI* removes decision fatigue

There are no projects to set up, no tags, no to-do list.
Just a timer, a few buttons, and a feedback loop.

Every “Start → Pause → Resume → Done” cycle is a tiny experiment in flow.

## 🧰 6. Under the Hood (for the Nerds)

A few technical notes for anyone curious (or wanting to build something similar):

* **CustomTkinter** handles the dark-mode GUI, tooltips, buttons, and stats window
* **Pygame** powers the audio playback for milestone sounds
* **`datetime` + `timedelta`** track study time vs. break time precisely
* **Toplevel windows** provide a separate, always-on-top stats panel
* A `resource_path()` helper keeps file paths working in both dev mode and compiled `.exe` builds

Everything runs locally. No accounts, no servers, no API calls.

## 🪶 7. Planned Upgrades

I’m slowly adding features while keeping the core experience simple. On the roadmap:

* 🪄 **Session naming** (e.g., “Thesis – Chapter 4”, “Calorimetry Data Cleanup”)
* 📤 **Automatic CSV / Google Sheets export** with date, duration, and break stats
* 🎧 **Sound themes** — Classic, Meme, Chill, etc.
* 🕹️ **Compact overlay HUD** for multi-monitor flows

When these land, I’ll update the app and this post with a small changelog.

## 🧩 Final Thoughts

The **LifeLoggerz StudyTimer** is how I measure the invisible:
the quiet hours that actually move projects forward.
