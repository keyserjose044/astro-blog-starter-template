# 🧠 LifeLoggerz Q&A — Tracking Life, One Cell at a Time

Welcome to **LifeLoggerz**, a blog by a grad student obsessed with data and self-improvement.  
I’ve been tracking dozens of aspects of my daily life in Google Sheets for years, everything from sleep and food to diary logs and time spent on hobbies.  

Here are some of the most common questions I get about how (and why) I do it.

---

## 💬 How do you have so much time?

It’s not that I *have* more time, I've simply **removed what doesn’t matter**. Remember that **everyone has 24 hours in a day**.
Everyone eats, sleeps, uses the restroom, etc. The key is to optimize the remaining time. Is there something you can improve the efficiency of at work or in your personal life? **Do it**.

**Logging my life** helps me see where my time actually goes. Once you see clearly, you realize how much of your day you can reclaim.
I've automated processes and cut out/merged tasks to where I have more available time. 
For instance, I don't watch TV/Netflix/Movies or look at social media/the news. Instead I listen to audiobooks while doing menial tasks (ex: driving) and this leaves me time for creative hobbies.
Plenty of other tips and tricks for saving time that you'll find on LifeLoggerz!

## ⏰ How long does life logging take each day?

Only about **3–5 minutes per day** for the bare essentials. 
Most stats are quick notes in my *Raw Data* sheet. My diary logs take a little longer — maybe 10–30 minutes at night when I’m winding down. It's up to you how much you want to track, I find that journaling the day's events gives context to the stats logged for a given day.

The system’s mostly automated with **Google Apps Script**. I built pop-up input forms, automatic daily backups, and other functions so logging feels effortless.  
It’s less of a chore and more of a nightly reflection ritual, something that at this point I can't fathom skipping for even a day.

## 🧩 What have you learned from tracking your life?

A lot. I mean that sincerely, it's helped me grow in many ways:

- **Time awareness** — Life moves fast until you track it. Looking back at any day in 2023 or 2024, I can recall what I did, what I ate, and how I felt.
- **Sharper memory** — Logging daily strengthens your recall; small details start to stick naturally. No longer do I struggle to remember what I had for breakfast, or when I got home.
- **Accountability through data** — The spreadsheet never lies. It shows you your habits and gives you fuel for improvement.

## 🕶 Do you track “wasted time”?

Ironically, no. Otherwise, I'd know how much time was spent on building all of these systems. /s
In truth, I used to, but I find that I go too far and treat 'closing my eyes to rest after a long work session' as wasted time. 
You can never be 100% productive. What matters is that you see how much you accomplish even on your toughest days.
If you want your dashboard to display “4 hours, 57 minutes, and 32 seconds wasted today,” feel free to add it.
I personally prefer to see what meaningful things occupy my time. Wasted time is something I’m already aware of and I don’t need a reminder for it.

## 📄 Can I have your templates?

Absolutely.  

The **LifeLoggerz Templates** are **free** to download.  
They're simple, clean, and the spreadsheet ones work best in **Google Sheets** (you can migrate it to Excel if you wish).

You can:
- Delete sheets you don’t need (e.g., *Blunders* → add *Mood* or *Calories* instead)
- Use it without scripts or formulas
- Add automation later through **Google Apps Script**

> 🧠 *Pro tip:* If you want to use Apps Script, make sure it’s a native Google Sheet (`.gsheet`), not a `.xlsx` import.

---

## 🔁 Will you keep doing this forever?

Pretty much.  
I can’t imagine *not* logging. It’s become second nature.  

If I skip a night because I'm super busy/tired/sick, I fill it in the next morning by memory. It has to get done, no excuses.  

Every year, I refine the templates, improve the visuals, and share free resources so others can join in tracking for self-improvement/reflection.
**LifeLoggerz** isn’t a one-time project. You'll see this site grow in content.

## 📱 Why not build an app for this?

I’ve thought about it. But I love how transparent Google Sheets is.  
You can *see* every formula, tweak it, and understand the logic.  

Apps tend to hide the system; Sheets teaches you how it works.  
Plus, you already have the tool — it’s free, cloud-based, and endlessly customizable.  

Maybe one day I’ll turn it into an app, but for now, **I want to empower people to build their own systems**.

## 🚀 What’s next?

2026 is about sharing everything I’ve built — not just the sheets, but the philosophy behind them. Stick around!
