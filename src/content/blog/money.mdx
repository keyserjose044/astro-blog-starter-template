While LifeLoggerz began as a habit-tracking project, one of the most powerful parts of the system became my **financial tracker**.
This Google Sheets setup shows exactly where my money goes, how much I save, and what my spending says about my decisions.

This blog post breaks down the system you see in my screenshots: the yearly savings chart, category breakdowns, month-by-month tables, and the raw data sheet where every expense is tagged and explained.

If you want to build something similar, you can copy parts or adapt the whole thing.

## Why track finances this way? (Short version)

- Money tells the truth — about priorities, habits, and discipline.  
- Budgeting apps never gave me the level of detail I needed.  
- Google Sheets lets me build **exactly** what I want:  
  formulas, colors, categories, dashboards, and automation.

> I treat money like data. When it’s visualized clearly, the stress disappears and the progress becomes obvious.

## How my financial tracker evolved (V1 → V3)

| Year | Version | Big changes |
|---:|:---|:---|
| **2023** | **V1** | Simple income–expense table, manual monthly totals |
| **2024** | **V2** | Added categories, formulas, color-coding, savings tracking |
| **2025** | **V3** | Full dashboard: savings graph, expense pie chart, category insights, automated monthly rollups |

*(I’ll add screenshots in the gallery — you can literally see the glow-up.)*

## What I track (the financial version)

Here’s the overview visible in my dashboard:

### **1. Income**
- Paychecks  
- Side hustles  
- Gifts, scholarships, grants  

### **2. Expenses**  
Every dollar gets a home in a category:

- HP (Health Products)  
- Gas  
- Food  
- Donations/Tips/Gifts  
- Self/Personal (S/P)  
- Haircut  
- Clothes  
- Insurance  
- Car  
- Health  
- Rent  
- Misc  

Your sheet may look different — mine reflects my life as a student, researcher, and someone who lives simply on purpose.

### **3. Savings**
- Daily running balance  
- Monthly net gains  
- Year-to-date total  
- A large visual graph showing swings and discipline

### **4. Money Explained (Raw Data)**
The raw data sheet is where each line item is broken down into:
- **What I spent**  
- **Why I spent it**  
- **Color-coded categories**  
- **Daily savings snapshot**  
- **Income recorded individually**  
- **Gains (like selling old items or storage unit finds)**

It acts like a diary — but in dollars.

## The real benefit: money becomes a mirror

After three years of maintaining this system, here’s what I learned:

### 🔍 1. Financial patterns become obvious  
You quickly see:
- which categories dominate your spending  
- which months spike  
- and how consistent (or inconsistent) your savings habits are  

### 📊 2. Monthly dashboards motivate consistency  
When your savings line visibly rises each week, you want to keep the slope green.

### 💵 3. Zero guilt, maximum clarity  
Tracking money removes uncertainty.  
If I overspend, I *see it*.  
If I’m disciplined, the chart rewards me.

### 🛠 4. Easy to update (1–5 minutes per day)  
Because the system is:
- color-coded  
- category locked  
- formula-powered  

I log expenses quickly and painlessly.

## How the system works (quick explanation)

### **1. Raw Data Sheet — the engine**

You type:
- the date  
- the money explained (e.g., "$20 gas, $11 subway sandwich")  
- the amount (green for gains, red for expenses)  
- the category in its column  

Everything else is automated.

### **2. Monthly Rollup — the logic**

Formulas calculate:
- income  
- expenses  
- net  
- category totals  
- % changes compared to last year  

### **3. Dashboard — the story**

The top sheet visually displays:
- the **Yearly Savings Graph**  
- the **Expenses Pie Chart**  
- a **Vanguard Investment Tracker**  
- and the **Current Month Tile View** of each category

It becomes your financial “homepage.”
