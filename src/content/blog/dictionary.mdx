# 📚 Reading the Dictionary — One Page a Day Since 12/22/22

On **December 22, 2022**, I began reading the *Merriam-Webster 10th Collegiate Dictionary* from **A** to **Z**.  
No skipping, no scanning—**one page a day**, every day. As of **November 11, 2025**, I’m on **page 1236**, nearing the end.

Each session takes about **five minutes**. I look at every entry, study the **etymologies**, and **highlight** words I don’t know or find especially interesting.

## 🧭 Why Read a Dictionary?

Not for memorization. For **exposure**.  
Tracing words back to Latin, Greek, Old English, and beyond changed how I see language. Roots connect families of meaning; prefixes and suffixes become reliable tools; spellings stop being arbitrary and start being historical.

> Some people read novels; I’ve been reading the **map** that all novels are built from.

## 🔁 The Habit Engine

This project runs alongside other **non-negotiable** dailies:

- 🎸 **Guitar:** at least **10 minutes/day** — **350+ hours** in the past two years  
- 📜 **Bible:** **1 chapter/day** — finished the whole Bible this year after ~3 years

What they taught me is simple:

- **Gains are gradual.** Five quiet minutes compound into something loud.  
- **Momentum is sacred.** The streak removes the decision; you just show up.  
- **Discipline transfers.** Master one small daily and you can apply it anywhere.

## 🔎 How I Work a Page

1. Read every headword and definition  
2. Note pronunciation and part of speech  
3. Follow the **etymology** trail (the best part)  
4. **Highlight** unknown or delightful words for later review

It’s a micro-ritual—short enough to do tired, meaningful enough to do proudly.

## 🏁 Almost There

Soon I’ll close the back cover. But the real win already happened:  
this habit re-wired my approach to big goals. **Five minutes a day** can climb mountains—whether paper mountains of words, pages of Scripture, or hours of music practice.

**Persistence**: that’s the definition worth committing to memory.
