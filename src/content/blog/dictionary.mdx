On **December 22, 2022**, I started reading the *Merriam-Webster 10th Collegiate Dictionary* — from start to finish.  
No skipping, no shortcuts. One page a day, every day.  

Each page takes about five minutes. I read every word, examine the etymologies, and highlight the ones I don’t know or find fascinating. I’ve treated it like a pilgrimage through language — tracing the lineage of words back through Latin, Greek, Old English, and beyond.

As of **November 11, 2025**, I’m on **page 1236**, nearing the end. That’s almost **three years** of uninterrupted progress — a five-minute ritual that became one of the most meaningful habits of my life.

### 🕰 Why Read the Dictionary?

When I started, it wasn’t about memorization. It was about exposure — to the raw material of thought.  
Reading the dictionary slowly reshapes your brain: you start seeing the hidden roots between words, the shared ancestry of meanings, the quiet logic behind English itself.

Some people read novels; I read the map that all novels are built from.

### 📖 The Discipline Behind It

At first, one page didn’t seem like much. But that’s the point.  
**Five minutes a day** is nothing—until you repeat it for 1,000 days. Then it becomes everything.

This dictionary project has run alongside two other non-negotiable habits:

- 🎸 *At least 10 minutes of guitar a day* — now over **350+ hours** of practice in two years.  
- 📜 *One Bible chapter a day* — finished reading the entire Bible this year after three years.

These habits all share the same DNA: **consistency over intensity**.  
You don’t conquer big goals by willpower bursts; you chip at them daily until they yield.

### 🧠 What It’s Taught Me

- **Gains are gradual.** The daily effort compounds invisibly, like interest.  
- **Momentum is sacred.** Missing one day invites doubt; keeping the streak makes the task effortless.  
- **Language is alive.** Words are fossils of human experience — clues to how people once thought.  
- **Discipline transfers.** Once you can commit to five minutes of reading, you can commit to anything.

### ⏳ The Power of the Page

The dictionary became a mirror: a record of persistence disguised as paper and ink.  
Some nights, I’d barely have the energy to read a page — but I did it anyway. And the next morning, I’d remember that *this* is how mountains are climbed.

Not in leaps, but in pages.

### 🏁 Almost There

Soon, I’ll close the final page. But the point was never to finish — it was to *continue*.  
The habit of showing up for five minutes a day now underlies everything I do: research, writing, guitar, and even life itself.

Persistence, it turns out, is the real definition worth memorizing.
