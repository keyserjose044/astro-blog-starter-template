# ✍️ A Simple Shorthand System — Before You Commit to Something Harder

Back in **2021**, I looked into traditional shorthand systems like **Gregg** and **Pitman**.  
They fascinated me — fast, elegant, and used by reporters and court clerks for over a century.  
But the idea of learning a *new writing system* (new alphabet, new symbols, months of training) was… intimidating.

So, I went the **LifeLoggerz route**: build a system that’s *just enough*.

I began developing my own **suffix-based shorthand**, designed to make writing faster without requiring full retraining.  
It’s not about perfection — it’s about *speed and efficiency* in everyday writing, especially for note-heavy STEM work.

---

## 🔡 The Core Idea

Instead of creating a new alphabet, I focused on the **most common suffixes** and **word endings** — things like:

- `-tion`, `-sion`, `-ion`
- `-ing`
- `-ity`, `-ety`
- `-ness`
- `-less`
- `-ment`
- `-able`, `-ible`
- `-ance`, `-ence`

Each one gets its own **symbol** — a small curl, slash, or curve that you can append naturally at the end of a root word.  
The result? A smooth flow that *feels like normal writing*, just stripped down.

## ✂️ Suffix Examples

Here are a few from my handwritten system:

| Suffix | Shorthand Symbol | Example |
| ------- | ---------------- | -------- |
| -tion / -sion / -ion | → (curve mark) | *education → educ→* |
| -ing | ⤴ | *running → run⤴* |
| -ity / -ety | ɪ | *velocity → velocɪ* |
| -ness | ʃ | *kindness → kindʃ* |
| -able / -ible | ∆ | *readable → read∆* |
| -ment | ɯ | *development → developɯ* |

The exact symbols are personal — what matters is the *consistency*.  
Once your brain internalizes them, you’ll find yourself writing at a steady sprint.

## 🧠 Abbreviations for Common Words

After the suffixes, I made a second page with **abbreviations** for frequent words and phrases.  
This is where the real speed boost happens.

A few examples from my list:

| Word / Phrase | Abbreviation | Notes |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------ |
| `th` / `ch` / `sh` | θ / ç / ʃ | Simple sound-based marks |
| `to` | 2 | Obvious and fast |
| `and` | ʎ | Connected curve |
| `because` | β | Logic symbol |
| `with` | ŵ | Works well mid-sentence |
| `from` | ∿ | Quick horizontal flick |
| `everybody` | e/b | Compound logic |
| `teacher` | Tch | Only two letters |
| `something` | smt | Compact & clear |
| `would` | wʊ | Phonetic memory anchor |

You’ll notice it’s a mix of **phonetics, logic, and instinct** — whatever made writing faster while staying legible.

## ⚙️ How I Use It

I mostly use my shorthand system for:

- **Lab notes** — especially when jotting down equations or test setups  
- **Meeting notes** — where every second counts  
- **Diary entries** — because I like the privacy of semi-decipherable handwriting  
- **Brainstorming** — quick ideas without losing the flow of thought

And yes, it’s *harder for others to read*.  
So if you’re a student or researcher who takes personal notes — that’s a bonus.

---

## 🚀 Why This Works (Even If It’s Not “True” Shorthand)

This isn’t meant to replace real shorthand.  
It’s meant to **get you into the mindset** of fast, structured writing without the cognitive overload.

You’ll:
- Train your brain to **see patterns in words**  
- Gain the satisfaction of a **private, personalized writing system**  
- Build muscle memory that prepares you for full shorthand systems later  

The idea is to **bridge the gap** — from ordinary handwriting to professional shorthand — with zero frustration.

## 🧩 What’s Next

I’d like to eventually expand this into:
- A clean digital chart version (PDF cheat sheet)  
- A font or notation guide  
- A hybrid notebook format where shorthand is paired with normal notes

It’s one of those small, quirky projects that blends perfectly with the **LifeLoggerz** philosophy:  
*personal efficiency born from curiosity.*
