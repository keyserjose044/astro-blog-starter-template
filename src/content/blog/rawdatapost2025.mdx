# 📊 The Raw Data Sheets — Quantifying My Life One Day at a Time

This is my **bread and butter spreadsheet** — the one I open every single day without fail. My pride and joy, my life's work.
It’s the heart of LifeLoggerz: a living document in **Google Sheets** that quietly turns days into data, data into trends, and trends into understanding.
Ironically, building all of these sheets is the one thing that I didn't track timewise. Hundreds of hours have gone into the structure of my sheets.
However, filling this in every day only takes a few minutes.

## 🌱 How It All Began

In 2022, I was simply writing **daily diary logs**.  
They captured my thoughts well — but they didn’t quantify anything.  
So in 2023, I decided to bring structure into the mix.

---

### 🗓 2023 — The Barebones Beginning

  <figcaption><em>2023: Where it all started. Just a few stats — minimal, mostly monochrome, and size 8 font.</em></figcaption>
</figure>

Back then, my tracking consisted of **six metrics** all on just one sheet:
- Sleep: Wake Up Time, Hours Slept
- Food: Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner
- Summary of the Day: short phrase with day's most important events  

No fancy formatting, more stats came later (the ones to the right).

### 💡 2024 — The Awakening

<figure>

  <figcaption><em>2024: Color enters the picture. The system starts expanding — one sheet for every facet of life.</em></figcaption>
</figure>

By 2024, I discovered that my diary logs contained valuable **quantifiable patterns**.  
Why keep them hidden in text when I could visualize them?  
So I expanded my spreadsheet — each part of my daily life got its own tab (shown in depth below).

I began **color-coding** and **indexing** every entry — the moment LifeLoggerz became a true data system.

### 📈 2024 — The First Graphs

<figure>

  <figcaption><em>The birth of visual feedback — graphs for habits, work hours, and wellness.</em></figcaption>
</figure>

This was the first time I saw **my life in charts** thanks to all the data I was collecting.
Suddenly, I could see when I was most productive, most social, or most consistent.  
Even with all these extra stats, filling this in daily is a small commitment with big mental benefits.

### 🚀 2025 — The Refined System

<figure>
  <img src="/images/rawdatapost/2025-raw-data-sheet.png" alt="2025 Raw Data Sheet" />
  <figcaption><em>2025: A mature system — structured, colorful, and interconnected across sheets.</em></figcaption>
</figure>

By 2025, I had everything I needed to run full-scale analytics on my life.
The only thing missing was the knowledge of conditional formattting, Google App Scripts, and advanced formulas to simplify/automate laborious tasks.
For instance, alternating weeks are different colors, and weekends are maroon.
Alternating months are different colors (yellow for odd months, purple for even months). 
With code scripts, I can automate tasks like bringing in my daily image from Google Drive, or condensing my diary logs with ChatGPT API.

If you want to know everything that I track just on this one sheet: Sleep, Meals, Weather, Summary of Day, Work, Hobbies, Audiobooks 
- Column D: Time I Went to Sleep at
- Column E: Hours Slept
- Column F: Time I Woke up at
- Column G: Naps
- Column I: Breakfast
- Column J: Lunch
- Column K: Dinner
- Column N: Temperature Highs
- Column O: Temperature Lows
- Column Q: Summary of Day
- Column R - Diary Log Word Count
- Column T - Work Description
- Column U - Hours Worked
- Column W - Religious Study
- Column X - Dictionary Page
- Column Y - Language Study
- Column Z - Running (Miles)
- Column AA - Treadmill (Minutes at 2mph)
- Column AB - Guitar
- Columns AD, AE, AF: Audiobooks (timestamp, min)

Notice how there's colors everywhere? **Conditional formatting** does that work for me. 
I use symbols like [, @, ", *, $, #, and these paint the cells automatically.
These colors mean different things, and they're incredibly useful for spotting patterns.
Grey in the Sleep section means that I stayed up past 1am.
Baby blue in the Weather section means it snowed, red means it was over 100 degrees F. 
Green in the Audiobooks section represents a new audiobook.
And so on, and so on. These sheets have data on top of data!

Anyway, let's move on. 

> Check out the individual sheets below — the “organs” that make up this living system.

## 🧩 The Individual Sheets

Each sheet focuses on one aspect of daily life, working in harmony to build a full picture.  
These are all part of the **Raw Data workbook** — the foundation of everything else.

---

### 💰 Money

Money tells stories: of priorities, habits, and decisions.  
This sheet shows what I spend on, what I invest in, and how balanced the month feels.

---

### 📜 Logs (Complete)

  <img src="/images/rawdatapost/rawdata-logs.png" alt="Raw Data Logs" />
  <figcaption><em>The complete daily log — a full written record of the day’s thoughts and actions.</em></figcaption>

This is where **raw reflection** lives. Every event, every thought, every memory.

---

### ⚙️ Logs (Condensed)

Google Apps Script + ChatGPT compress these entries into short summaries, letting me see patterns without losing meaning.

---

### 💬 Quotes

Each quote represents a moment of insight — sometimes my own, sometimes borrowed wisdom.

---

### 💥 Blunders

<figure>
  <img src="/images/rawdatapost/rawdata-blunders.png" alt="Raw Data Blunders" />
  <figcaption><em>Failures become data too — each mistake is logged, tagged, and learned from.</em></figcaption>
</figure>

Logging mistakes removes their sting — they become part of improvement, not shame.

---

### 👕 Outfits

<figure>
  <img src="/images/rawdatapost/rawdata-outfits.png" alt="Raw Data Outfits" />
  <figcaption><em>Daily outfits — color-coded for style, weather, and repetition tracking.</em></figcaption>
</figure>

It’s not vanity; it’s curiosity.  
Patterns emerge — color preferences, weather adaptation, and even mood expression.

---

### 🍽 Food

<figure>
  <img src="/images/rawdatapost/rawdata-food.png" alt="Raw Data Food" />
  <figcaption><em>Every meal logged — for health, enjoyment, and consistency.</em></figcaption>

Trends in diet reveal much about discipline and mood.  
You can see when stress peaks, or when creativity flows — through what’s on the plate.

---

### 📍 Places

<figure>
  <img src="/images/rawdatapost/rawdata-places.png" alt="Raw Data Places" />
  <figcaption><em>Where I went — a spatial record of movement and presence.</em></figcaption>
</figure>

Each cell is a breadcrumb of geography.  
Over time, it shows whether I’ve become more exploratory or more homebound.

---

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 People

<figure>
  <img src="/images/rawdatapost/rawdata-peeps.png" alt="Raw Data People" />
  <figcaption><em>People and interactions — a map of my social world.</em></figcaption>
</figure>

This sheet shows the rhythms of my relationships — who I see most, and how that changes over time.

---

## 📊 Advanced Visuals & Dashboards

The next layer of the system uses formulas to visualize patterns across weeks, months, and categories.  
These **advanced sheets** transform data into insight — and beauty.

---

### 🧮 Dashboard

It’s a mirror for weekend balance — too many blank cells means too much solitude.

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

There’s much more here than meets the eye.  
Behind these sheets run **Google Apps Scripts** that automate summaries, manage file imports, and communicate with **ChatGPT’s API** to create condensed diary entries automatically.

Each post in this series will uncover a new part of that system — how automation and design turn everyday life into an evolving dataset.
