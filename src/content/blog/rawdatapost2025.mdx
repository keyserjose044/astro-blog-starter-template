# 📊 The Raw Data Sheets — Quantifying My Life One Day at a Time

This is my **bread and butter spreadsheet** — the one I open every single day without fail.  
It’s the heart of LifeLoggerz: a living document in **Google Sheets** that quietly turns days into data, data into trends, and trends into understanding.

---

## 🌱 How It All Began

In 2022, I was simply writing **daily diary logs**.  
They captured my thoughts well — but they didn’t quantify anything.  
So in 2023, I decided to bring structure into the mix.

---

### 🗓 2023 — The Barebones Beginning

<figure>
  <img src="/images/rawdatapost/2023-raw-data-sheet.png" alt="2023 Raw Data Sheet" />
  <figcaption><em>2023: Where it all started. Just seven stats — minimal, monochrome, and a humble size 8 font.</em></figcaption>
</figure>

Back then, my tracking consisted of **seven metrics**:
- 3 for sleep  
- 3 for food  
- 1 short phrase summarizing the day  

No colors. No fancy formatting.  
Just a blank grid and the determination to understand myself through numbers.

### 💡 2024 — The Awakening

  <figcaption><em>2024: Color enters the picture. The system starts expanding — one sheet for every facet of life.</em></figcaption>
</figure>

By 2024, I discovered that my diary logs contained valuable **quantifiable patterns**.  
Why keep them hidden in text when I could visualize them?  
So I expanded my spreadsheet — each part of my daily life got its own tab:
- Food
- People
- Quotes
- Blunders
- Outfits
- Places
- And more  

I began **color-coding** and **indexing** every entry — the moment LifeLoggerz became a true data system.

### 📈 2024 — The First Graphs

  <figcaption><em>The birth of visual feedback — graphs for habits, work hours, and wellness.</em></figcaption>
</figure>

This was the first time I saw **my life in charts**.  
Suddenly, I could see when I was most productive, most social, or most consistent.  
It was addictive.

### 🚀 2025 — The Refined System

<figure>

  <figcaption><em>2025: A mature system — structured, colorful, and interconnected across sheets.</em></figcaption>
</figure>

By 2025, I had everything I needed to run full-scale analytics on my life.  
Each dropdown, each cell, each IF formula connects to a broader network of formulas across sheets.

> Check out the individual sheets below — the “organs” that make up this living system.

---

## 🧩 The Individual Sheets

Each sheet focuses on one aspect of daily life, working in harmony to build a full picture.  
These are all part of the **Raw Data workbook** — the foundation of everything else.

### 💰 Money

Money tells stories: of priorities, habits, and decisions.  
This sheet shows what I spend on, what I invest in, and how balanced the month feels.

### 📜 Logs (Complete)

Google Apps Script + ChatGPT compress these entries into short summaries, letting me see patterns without losing meaning.

### 💬 Quotes

Each quote represents a moment of insight — sometimes my own, sometimes borrowed wisdom.

---

### 💥 Blunders

<figure>
  <img src="/images/rawdatapost/rawdata-blunders.png" alt="Raw Data Blunders" />
  <figcaption><em>Failures become data too — each mistake is logged, tagged, and learned from.</em></figcaption>

Logging mistakes removes their sting — they become part of improvement, not shame.

---

### 👕 Outfits

<figure>
  <img src="/images/rawdatapost/rawdata-outfits.png" alt="Raw Data Outfits" />
  <figcaption><em>Daily outfits — color-coded for style, weather, and repetition tracking.</em></figcaption>

It’s not vanity; it’s curiosity.  
Patterns emerge — color preferences, weather adaptation, and even mood expression.

### 🍽 Food

<figure>
  <img src="/images/rawdatapost/rawdata-food.png" alt="Raw Data Food" />
  <figcaption><em>Every meal logged — for health, enjoyment, and consistency.</em></figcaption>

Trends in diet reveal much about discipline and mood.  
You can see when stress peaks, or when creativity flows — through what’s on the plate.

### 📍 Places

<figure>
  <img src="/images/rawdatapost/rawdata-places.png" alt="Raw Data Places" />
  <figcaption><em>Where I went — a spatial record of movement and presence.</em></figcaption>

Each cell is a breadcrumb of geography.  
Over time, it shows whether I’ve become more exploratory or more homebound.

---

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 People

<figure>
  <img src="/images/rawdatapost/rawdata-peeps.png" alt="Raw Data People" />
  <figcaption><em>People and interactions — a map of my social world.</em></figcaption>

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

There’s much more here than meets the eye.  
Behind these sheets run **Google Apps Scripts** that automate summaries, manage file imports, and communicate with **ChatGPT’s API** to create condensed diary entries automatically.

Each post in this series will uncover a new part of that system — how automation and design turn everyday life into an evolving dataset.
