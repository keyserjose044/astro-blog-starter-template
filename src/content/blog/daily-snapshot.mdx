# 📅 The Daily Snapshot — A Day of Data in Motion

The **Daily Snapshot** is where all the data from my *Raw Data Sheets* comes to life.  
Every meal, outfit, quote, interaction, and diary entry funnels here — indexed from dozens of columns spread across my Google Sheets ecosystem.

---

## 🧩 1. How It All Connects

Each day’s entry is a product of **52 formulas** drawing from the *Current Year’s Raw Data Sheets*.  
Every dropdown I fill out adds to an expanding database: meals, people, weather, hobbies, blunders, quotes, and more.

*INDEX(), MATCH(), IFERROR() stitch everything together. Photo-of-the-day appears via a parsed Google Drive link displayed with `IMAGE()`.*

## 🔮 5. Day-vs-Day Archive Comparison

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

This *Daily Snapshot* is where **data becomes reflection**. Soon, each layer gets its own post:
